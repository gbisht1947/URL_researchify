It’s defined as the ability to produce maximal force against a specific — and usually external — resistance (1Trusted Source).\\n\\nKnowing how to build strength can be helpful — no matter if you’re an older adult who’s worried about safely getting up from a chair or if you’re younger and looking to perform a heavier bench press.\\n\\nA recent study showed that greater strength is linked to decreases in all mortality causes. Another study found a link between strength training and improved physical function in individuals experiencing chronic pain (2Trusted Source, 3Trusted Source).\\n\\nPeople perform resistance training for a variety of reasons. Some are interested in being the strongest they can be or avoiding injury, others are interested in sculpting a better physique with larger muscles, and some wish to perform better at certain sports.\\n\\nNo matter your goals, you may be unsure of the best way to increase your strength. It’s important to know that it takes long-term consistency to achieve results and that you must manipulate certain variables to challenge your body to lift heavier loads.\\n\\nThis can involve:\\n\\nincreasing the weight\\n\\nvarying the number of repetitions per set\\n\\nadjusting the number of days you lift\\n\\nchanging how long you rest between sets\\n\\nadjusting how many sets you perform\\n\\nBelow are some ways to improve strength that address the topics.\\n\\nShare on Pinterest\\n\\nHow long does it take to build strength?\\n\\nWhen it comes to building strength, long-term consistency is key.\\n\\nA recent review found that it typically takes between 6–15 weeks before you start seeing any appreciable strength gains (4Trusted Source).\\n\\nNevertheless, you may still experience strength gains within the first couple of weeks of training, linked to your brain adapting to training. In fact, these immediate strength gains are typically seen in untrained individuals more so than in trained individuals (5Trusted Source).\\n\\nIt’s worth noting that building muscle differs from building strength. With muscle building, the goal is to increase muscle size — also known as inducing muscle hypertrophy. This is not necessarily the goal when building strength (5Trusted Source).\\n\\nComparatively, appreciable muscle hypertrophy tends to take at least 8–12 weeks, though this is highly dependent on nutrition, intensity, frequency, and other factors like age and sex (6).\\n\\nBuilding appreciable strength typically takes at least 6–15 weeks while building appreciable muscle typically takes at least 8–12 weeks.\\n\\nGoals for weight training\\n\\nWeight training comes with a wealth of benefits. In addition to improved overall health, some goals for weight training include increased strength, muscle building, endurance, and power.\\n\\nStrength\\n\\nA primary goal of strength training is to get your body to adapt to lifting heavier loads. To assess if your strength has increased, you can perform a test.\\n\\nFor example, you can test if your 1 rep max (1RM) lift of a specific exercise, such as the bench press or squat, improves over time. In other words, you can identify if you can perform one repetition of an exercise with increasing loads as you progress.\\n\\nStudies have shown that increasing strength requires lifting with loads at greater than or equal to 60% of your 1RM load. Loads of at least 80% of your 1RM load may produce better strength gains if you have previous training experience (7Trusted Source, 8Trusted Source).\\n\\nCurrent recommendations for increasing strength through resistance training are to complete 1–8 repetitions until muscle failure — which is when you’re unable to perform another repetition. Research suggests performing 3–6 of these sets per exercise (1Trusted Source, 9Trusted Source).\\n\\nOne study found that rest periods of 3 minutes are optimal for inducing strength changes. Yet, resting for 1–3 minutes between sets may be more beneficial from a time-saving standpoint (10Trusted Source).\\n\\nKeep in mind that strength training will vary with the individual. It’s reliant on previous training history, injuries, age, motivation, and more (9Trusted Source).\\n\\nThus, it’s best to adjust training parameters to your ability, time allotment, and motivation level. For example, if you’re over 45 years of age, you may benefit from lower loads, such as 60% of your 1-RM load (9Trusted Source).\\n\\nHypertrophy\\n\\nAs mentioned, the goal of hypertrophy training is to increase muscle size.\\n\\nMaximal lifting may not need to be part of this program.\\n\\nFor example, one study found that hypertrophy can occur with loads as low as 30% of the 1 RM. Still, greater gains in muscle size were seen with loads of 60% or greater. The important factor remained to train with a high intensity until muscular failure (8Trusted Source).\\n\\nA 2016 study observed that muscle mass increased when a participant performed 3 sets of 8–12 repetitions to muscular failure (11Trusted Source).\\n\\nIf your goal is growing muscle, you should rest between sets for 1–3 minutes — just like when working to increase strength. Interestingly, some studies postulate that longer rest between sets promotes increases in muscle endurance (10Trusted Source, 12Trusted Source).\\n\\nMuscular endurance\\n\\nMuscular endurance involves the ability to move a submaximal load while resisting muscle fatigue.\\n\\nTraining to improve muscle endurance typically involves using loads that are 40–60% of your 1 RM. This improves the muscle’s physiologic efficiency, enabling it to perform repeated contractions without getting fatigued (1Trusted Source).\\n\\nFunctionally, this allows you to push your body for longer, such as when jogging or swimming.\\n\\nTraining for muscular endurance typically involves performing 2–3 sets of 15 or more repetitions. Generally, the rest intervals are shorter, sitting around 30–60 seconds (1Trusted Source).\\n\\nPower\\n\\nMuscle power is the ability to produce force and speed to move yourself or an object — for example, in activities like sprinting, discus-throwing, slam-ball exercises, and jumping.\\n\\nThe ideal loads for training vary depending on the exercise.\\n\\nFor example, power movements like the squat or explosive lifts like the power clean respond best to loads of 30–70% of your 1RM. Meanwhile, explosive activities like jumping respond better to lighter loads around 30% of your 1RM (13Trusted Source).\\n\\nRepetitions for power training are meant to work on strength and speed and you should avoid training to muscle failure (14Trusted Source).\\n\\nThis type of training typically leans toward 1–3 sets of 4–10 reps. The rest periods are longer, lasting 3 or more minutes, allowing you to fully recover before performing again.\\n\\nIt can be paired with heavy resistance sets in what’s called contrast training. This can help develop strength and pre-fatigue the muscles. Combining a heavier resistance set with a much lighter speed-based movement enhances performance (15Trusted Source).\\n\\nOptimal strength training involves using a load of 80% or greater of your 1 RM, performing 1–8 repetitions for 3–6 sets, and resting 1–3 minutes between sets.\\n\\n6 ways to build strength\\n\\nBuilding strength is a multifaceted task. Here are some things to keep in mind.\\n\\nWarm up. When preparing to lift heavier weights, it’s important to warm up your body before performing. This can include lighter aerobic activity, lighter weight sets, and dynamic warm-up exercise like arms circles, leg kicks, and windmills.\\n\\nFocus on form. Keep good form when lifting to muscular failure. If you can no longer maintain good form, you’ve reached the failure point for that set.\\n\\nPrioritize progressive overload. Increase the volume of your repetitions to improve strength. This can be done by keeping the weight heavy, around >80% 1RM, and increasing the number of sets to 3–5.\\n\\nTry compound exercises. If you’re pressed for time, utilize compound exercises that involve multiple joints, such as the squat and bench press. They may offer more bang for your buck than single-joint isolation exercises like bicep curls or knee extensions.\\n\\nStay consistent. Keep consistent with strength training by performing strength workouts three times per week. This can be total-body training, or if preferred, you can alternate between upper- and lower-body training.\\n\\nSeek the help of others. Consider teaming up with a friend for motivation and to keep each other accountable. You can also seek out the guidance of a professional, like a personal trainer, to follow a tailored exercise program and advice.\\n\\nWarm up your body before lifting, maintain good form, gradually increase the volume of training, prioritize compound movements, stay consistent, and seek the help of others to improve your performance.\\n\\nHow to eat to support your strength goals\\n\\nIf you’re looking to enhance your strength and muscle mass, you’ll likely benefit from increasing your protein intake.\\n\\nThe current understanding is that getting up to 0.73 grams of protein per pound (1.6 grams per kg) of body weight each day can support muscle and strength growth. Any more than this will be excreted through your urine and provides no further benefits (16Trusted Source).\\n\\nFor example, a 155-pound (70-kg) person can benefit from up to 112 grams of protein per day. This can come from lean meat, poultry, and fish, as well as legumes, dairy, and grains. You can also use protein supplements, which are often soy, pea, or whey protein-based.\\n\\nTo optimize your body’s uptake, it my be best vary the protein sources you eat. This will add variety to your diet and ensure you get all the different amino acids — also known as the building blocks of protein (17Trusted Source).\\n\\nThe above recommendation does require an adequate exercise stimulus to be worth the increased intake. In other words, eating this much protein without also working out at a sufficient intensity is unlikely to stimulate muscle growth further.\\n\\nThose exercising less intensely may not need more than 0.36 grams per pound (0.8 grams per kg) of body weight per day (18Trusted Source).\\n\\nIn addition to getting enough protein, you should also aim to enjoy a balanced diet.\\n\\nThis includes high quality carbohydrates like whole grains alongside fruits and vegetables that provide fiber, vitamins, and minereals. Besides fueling your workouts, eating a balanced diet can benefit your health and help prevent disease (19Trusted Source, 20Trusted Source).\\n\\nIncreasing protein intake can improve strength. However, keep it below 1.6 grams per kilogram of body weight per day to be beneficial. Also eat a well-balanced diet in addition to the protein intake.\\n\\nThe bottom line\\n\\nBuilding strength requires consistency, intensity, patience, and dedication.\\n\\nThere are optimal levels of reps, sets, rest intervals, and frequency for different training purposes. Use them as a guideline and adjust them to what suits your body, lifestyle, and training goals.\\n\\nTo support your strength-gaining journey, it’s also important to eat a balanced diet high in protein.\\n\\nLast, but not least — happy training.\\n\\nLast medically reviewed on  April 1, 2022\\n\\nHow we reviewed this article:\\n\\nHistory\\n\\nOur experts continually monitor the health and wellness space, and we update our articles when new information becomes available.\\n\\nCurrent Version\\n\\nApr 1, 2022\\n\\nWritten By\\n\\nTravis Edwards, PT, MPT\\n\\nEdited By\\n\\nDaney Helgadóttir\\n\\nMedically Reviewed By\\n\\nJared Meacham, Ph.D., RD, PMP, MBA, CSCS\\n\\nCopy Edited By\\n\\nNutrition Copy Editors\\n\\nShare this article\\n\\nMedically reviewed by Jared Meacham, Ph.D., RD, PMP, MBA, CSCS —\\n\\nBy Travis Edwards, PT, MPT\\n\\non April 1, 2022\\n\\nRead this next\\n\\n14 Benefits of Strength TrainingMedically reviewed by Daniel Bubnis, M.S., NASM-CPT, NASE Level II-CSSStrength training can provide numerous benefits for people of every age, size, and shape.

But we can change how we move forward—on COVID-19 and other issues we must face together. \\n\\nI recently visited the New York City Police Department days after the funerals of Officer Wilbert Mora and his partner, Officer Jason Rivera. \\n\\nThey were responding to a 9-1-1 call when a man shot and killed them with a stolen gun. \\n\\nOfficer Mora was 27 years old. \\n\\nOfficer Rivera was 22. \\n\\nBoth Dominican Americans who’d grown up on the same streets they later chose to patrol as police officers. \\n\\nI spoke with their families and told them that we are forever in debt for their sacrifice, and we will carry on their mission to restore the trust and safety every community deserves.\\nSource: 24-pl\\nContent: And a proud Ukrainian people, who have known 30 years  of independence, have repeatedly shown that they will not tolerate anyone who tries to take their country backwards.  \\n\\nTo all Americans, I will be honest with you, as I’ve always promised. A Russian dictator, invading a foreign country, has costs around the world. \\n\\nAnd I’m taking robust action to make sure the pain of our sanctions  is targeted at Russia’s economy. And I will use every tool at our disposal to protect American businesses and consumers. \\n\\nTonight, I can announce that the United States has worked with 30 other countries to release 60 Million barrels of oil from reserves around the world.  \\n\\nAmerica will lead that effort, releasing 30 Million barrels from our own Strategic Petroleum Reserve. And we stand ready to do more if necessary, unified with our allies.  \\n\\nThese steps will help blunt gas prices here at home. And I know the news about what’s happening can seem alarming. \\n\\nBut I want you to know that we are going to be okay.\\nSource: 5-pl\\nContent: More support for patients and families. \\n\\nTo get there, I call on Congress to fund ARPA-H, the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health. \\n\\nIt’s based on DARPA—the Defense Department project that led to the Internet, GPS, and so much more.  \\n\\nARPA-H will have a singular purpose—to drive breakthroughs in cancer, Alzheimer’s, diabetes, and more. \\n\\nA unity agenda for the nation. \\n\\nWe can do this. \\n\\nMy fellow Americans—tonight , we have gathered in a sacred space—the citadel of our democracy. \\n\\nIn this Capitol, generation after generation, Americans have debated great questions amid great strife, and have done great things. \\n\\nWe have fought for freedom, expanded liberty, defeated totalitarianism and terror. \\n\\nAnd built the strongest, freest, and most prosperous nation the world has ever known. \\n\\nNow is the hour. \\n\\nOur moment of responsibility. \\n\\nOur test of resolve and conscience, of history itself. \\n\\nIt is in this moment that our character is formed.

And worst of all, so much loss of life. \\n\\nLet’s use this moment to reset. Let’s stop looking at COVID-19 as a partisan dividing line and see it for what it is: A God-awful disease.  \\n\\nLet’s stop seeing each other as enemies, and start seeing each other for who we really are: Fellow Americans.  \\n\\nWe can’t change how divided we’ve been. But we can change how we move forward—on COVID-19 and other issues we must face together. \\n\\nI recently visited the New York City Police Department days after the funerals of Officer Wilbert Mora and his partner, Officer Jason Rivera. \\n\\nThey were responding to a 9-1-1 call when a man shot and killed them with a stolen gun. \\n\\nOfficer Mora was 27 years old. \\n\\nOfficer Rivera was 22. \\n\\nBoth Dominican Americans who’d grown up on the same streets they later chose to patrol as police officers. \\n\\nI spoke with their families and told them that we are forever in debt for their sacrifice, and we will carry on their mission to restore the trust and safety every community deserves.\\nSource: 24-pl\\nContent: And a proud Ukrainian people, who have known 30 years  of independence, have repeatedly shown that they will not tolerate anyone who tries to take their country backwards.  \\n\\nTo all Americans, I will be honest with you, as I’ve always promised. A Russian dictator, invading a foreign country, has costs around the world. \\n\\nAnd I’m taking robust action to make sure the pain of our sanctions  is targeted at Russia’s economy. And I will use every tool at our disposal to protect American businesses and consumers. \\n\\nTonight, I can announce that the United States has worked with 30 other countries to release 60 Million barrels of oil from reserves around the world.  \\n\\nAmerica will lead that effort, releasing 30 Million barrels from our own Strategic Petroleum Reserve. And we stand ready to do more if necessary, unified with our allies.  \\n\\nThese steps will help blunt gas prices here at home. And I know the news about what’s happening can seem alarming. \\n\\nBut I want you to know that we are going to be okay.\\nSource: 5-pl\\nContent: More support for patients and families. \\n\\nTo get there, I call on Congress to fund ARPA-H, the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health. \\n\\nIt’s based on DARPA—the Defense Department project that led to the Internet, GPS, and so much more.  \\n\\nARPA-H will have a singular purpose—to drive breakthroughs in cancer, Alzheimer’s, diabetes, and more. \\n\\nA unity agenda for the nation. \\n\\nWe can do this. \\n\\nMy fellow Americans—tonight , we have gathered in a sacred space—the citadel of our democracy. \\n\\nIn this Capitol, generation after generation, Americans have debated great questions amid great strife, and have done great things. \\n\\nWe have fought for freedom, expanded liberty, defeated totalitarianism and terror. \\n\\nAnd built the strongest, freest, and most prosperous nation the world has ever known. \\n\\nNow is the hour. \\n\\nOur moment of responsibility. \\n\\nOur test of resolve and conscience, of history itself. \\n\\nIt is in this moment that our character is formed.

Members of Congress and the Cabinet. Justices of the Supreme Court. My fellow Americans.  \\n\\nLast year COVID-19 kept us apart. This year we are finally together again. \\n\\nTonight, we meet as Democrats Republicans and Independents. But most importantly as Americans. \\n\\nWith a duty to one another to the American people to the Constitution. \\n\\nAnd with an unwavering resolve that freedom will always triumph over tyranny. \\n\\nSix days ago, Russia’s Vladimir Putin sought to shake the foundations of the free world thinking he could make it bend to his menacing ways. But he badly miscalculated. \\n\\nHe thought he could roll into Ukraine and the world would roll over. Instead he met a wall of strength he never imagined. \\n\\nHe met the Ukrainian people. \\n\\nFrom President Zelenskyy to every Ukrainian, their fearlessness, their courage, their determination, inspires the world. \\n\\nGroups of citizens blocking tanks with their bodies. Everyone from students to retirees teachers turned soldiers defending their homeland.\\nSource: 0-pl\\nContent: And we won’t stop. \\n\\nWe have lost so much to COVID-19. Time with one another. And worst of all, so much loss of life. \\n\\nLet’s use this moment to reset. Let’s stop looking at COVID-19 as a partisan dividing line and see it for what it is: A God-awful disease.  \\n\\nLet’s stop seeing each other as enemies, and start seeing each other for who we really are: Fellow Americans.  \\n\\nWe can’t change how divided we’ve been. But we can change how we move forward—on COVID-19 and other issues we must face together. \\n\\nI recently visited the New York City Police Department days after the funerals of Officer Wilbert Mora and his partner, Officer Jason Rivera. \\n\\nThey were responding to a 9-1-1 call when a man shot and killed them with a stolen gun. \\n\\nOfficer Mora was 27 years old. \\n\\nOfficer Rivera was 22. \\n\\nBoth Dominican Americans who’d grown up on the same streets they later chose to patrol as police officers. \\n\\nI spoke with their families and told them that we are forever in debt for their sacrifice, and we will carry on their mission to restore the trust and safety every community deserves.\\nSource: 24-pl\\nContent: And a proud Ukrainian people, who have known 30 years  of independence, have repeatedly shown that they will not tolerate anyone who tries to take their country backwards.  \\n\\nTo all Americans, I will be honest with you, as I’ve always promised. A Russian dictator, invading a foreign country, has costs around the world. \\n\\nAnd I’m taking robust action to make sure the pain of our sanctions  is targeted at Russia’s economy. And I will use every tool at our disposal to protect American businesses and consumers. \\n\\nTonight, I can announce that the United States has worked with 30 other countries to release 60 Million barrels of oil from reserves around the world.  \\n\\nAmerica will lead that effort, releasing 30 Million barrels from our own Strategic Petroleum Reserve. And we stand ready to do more if necessary, unified with our allies.  \\n\\nThese steps will help blunt gas prices here at home. And I know the news about what’s happening can seem alarming. \\n\\nBut I want you to know that we are going to be okay.\\nSource: 5-pl\\nContent: More support for patients and families. \\n\\nTo get there, I call on Congress to fund ARPA-H, the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health. \\n\\nIt’s based on DARPA—the Defense Department project that led to the Internet, GPS, and so much more.  \\n\\nARPA-H will have a singular purpose—to drive breakthroughs in cancer, Alzheimer’s, diabetes, and more. \\n\\nA unity agenda for the nation. \\n\\nWe can do this. \\n\\nMy fellow Americans—tonight , we have gathered in a sacred space—the citadel of our democracy. \\n\\nIn this Capitol, generation after generation, Americans have debated great questions amid great strife, and have done great things. \\n\\nWe have fought for freedom, expanded liberty, defeated totalitarianism and terror. \\n\\nAnd built the strongest, freest, and most prosperous nation the world has ever known. \\n\\nNow is the hour. \\n\\nOur moment of responsibility. \\n\\nOur test of resolve and conscience, of history itself. \\n\\nIt is in this moment that our character is formed.

Avoid eating more than 300–500 extra calories per day to minimize gains in body fat.\\n\\nHow fast can you gain muscle?\\n\\nWhile gaining muscle is surprisingly simple compared with many other life goals, that doesn’t mean it’s easy — and it certainly doesn’t happen quickly.\\n\\nGaining serious muscle takes many months and years of weight training and proper eating. Muscle gain rates vary by individual, even when following the same program.\\n\\nOverall, with good nutrition and consistent training, research has found that 0.5–2 pounds (0.25–0.9 kg) of muscle growth per month is a good benchmark for maximal potential muscle growth (7Trusted Source).\\nQuestion: what is calorie deficit\\nRelevant text, if any:\"\n",

Members of Congress and the Cabinet. Justices of the Supreme Court. My fellow Americans.  \\n\\nLast year COVID-19 kept us apart. This year we are finally together again. \\n\\nTonight, we meet as Democrats Republicans and Independents. But most importantly as Americans. \\n\\nWith a duty to one another to the American people to the Constitution. \\n\\nAnd with an unwavering resolve that freedom will always triumph over tyranny. \\n\\nSix days ago, Russia’s Vladimir Putin sought to shake the foundations of the free world thinking he could make it bend to his menacing ways. But he badly miscalculated. \\n\\nHe thought he could roll into Ukraine and the world would roll over. Instead he met a wall of strength he never imagined. \\n\\nHe met the Ukrainian people. \\n\\nFrom President Zelenskyy to every Ukrainian, their fearlessness, their courage, their determination, inspires the world. \\n\\nGroups of citizens blocking tanks with their bodies. Everyone from students to retirees teachers turned soldiers defending their homeland.\\nSource: 0-pl\\nContent: And we won’t stop. \\n\\nWe have lost so much to COVID-19. Time with one another. And worst of all, so much loss of life. \\n\\nLet’s use this moment to reset. Let’s stop looking at COVID-19 as a partisan dividing line and see it for what it is: A God-awful disease.  \\n\\nLet’s stop seeing each other as enemies, and start seeing each other for who we really are: Fellow Americans.  \\n\\nWe can’t change how divided we’ve been. But we can change how we move forward—on COVID-19 and other issues we must face together. \\n\\nI recently visited the New York City Police Department days after the funerals of Officer Wilbert Mora and his partner, Officer Jason Rivera. \\n\\nThey were responding to a 9-1-1 call when a man shot and killed them with a stolen gun. \\n\\nOfficer Mora was 27 years old. \\n\\nOfficer Rivera was 22. \\n\\nBoth Dominican Americans who’d grown up on the same streets they later chose to patrol as police officers. \\n\\nI spoke with their families and told them that we are forever in debt for their sacrifice, and we will carry on their mission to restore the trust and safety every community deserves.\\nSource: 24-pl\\nContent: And a proud Ukrainian people, who have known 30 years  of independence, have repeatedly shown that they will not tolerate anyone who tries to take their country backwards.  \\n\\nTo all Americans, I will be honest with you, as I’ve always promised. A Russian dictator, invading a foreign country, has costs around the world. \\n\\nAnd I’m taking robust action to make sure the pain of our sanctions  is targeted at Russia’s economy. And I will use every tool at our disposal to protect American businesses and consumers. \\n\\nTonight, I can announce that the United States has worked with 30 other countries to release 60 Million barrels of oil from reserves around the world.  \\n\\nAmerica will lead that effort, releasing 30 Million barrels from our own Strategic Petroleum Reserve. And we stand ready to do more if necessary, unified with our allies.  \\n\\nThese steps will help blunt gas prices here at home. And I know the news about what’s happening can seem alarming. \\n\\nBut I want you to know that we are going to be okay.\\nSource: 5-pl\\nContent: More support for patients and families. \\n\\nTo get there, I call on Congress to fund ARPA-H, the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health. \\n\\nIt’s based on DARPA—the Defense Department project that led to the Internet, GPS, and so much more.  \\n\\nARPA-H will have a singular purpose—to drive breakthroughs in cancer, Alzheimer’s, diabetes, and more. \\n\\nA unity agenda for the nation. \\n\\nWe can do this. \\n\\nMy fellow Americans—tonight , we have gathered in a sacred space—the citadel of our democracy. \\n\\nIn this Capitol, generation after generation, Americans have debated great questions amid great strife, and have done great things. \\n\\nWe have fought for freedom, expanded liberty, defeated totalitarianism and terror. \\n\\nAnd built the strongest, freest, and most prosperous nation the world has ever known. \\n\\nNow is the hour. \\n\\nOur moment of responsibility. \\n\\nOur test of resolve and conscience, of history itself. \\n\\nIt is in this moment that our character is formed.
